# DeepOncology

This provides some deep Learning tools for automatic segmentation of 3D medical images (PET & CT scan), automatic classification of acquisition field of 2D images (from CT scan) and automatic prediction of survival of 3D medical images and patient's data. 

### Models
Model used for segmentation is [V-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797). <br/>
Model used for classification is a simply CNN.
